	<h1>Republish a text</h1>
	<p>I chose to create a Twitter account for the San Francisco pigeon. A character identity was assigned to a pigeon who speaks randomly through 140-character posts to the platform. The chosen text came from <a href="http://bit.ly/1FZDutX">http://bit.ly/1FZDutX</a>. There, excerpts were taken from the identification portion of the page and divided into bite sized posts. I also added my own text to before and after the inserted text to add a bit of context to the spoken dialogueâ€”creating a story. Each peice of text was posted at different intervals of time to keep readers engaged. Below are screenshots of the experiment.</p>
