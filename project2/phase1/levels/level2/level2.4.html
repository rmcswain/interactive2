<strong>C</strong>&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbspn&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspf&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspormity caught here, nobody catches it,
<br><strong>L</strong>&nbsp&nbspa&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspw&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspns groomed in prose, with hardly a stutter.
<br><strong>L</strong>&nbsp&nbspl&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspy&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspd hits the ball, and Lorraine fetches it.

<br><strong>M</strong>&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbspm hangs the laundry, Fred, Jr., watches it,
<br><strong>S</strong>&nbsp&nbsph&nbsp&nbspi&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspr&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspts in the cliched air, all aflutter.
<br><strong>C</strong>&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbspn&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspf&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspormity caught here, nobody catches it.

<br><strong>A</strong>&nbsp&nbspd&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspg drops a bone, another dog snatches it.
<br><strong>I</strong>&nbsp&nbspd&nbsp&nbspr&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspe&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspamed of this life once, Now I shudder
<br><strong>A</strong>&nbsp&nbsps L&nbsp&nbspl&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyd hits the ball and Lorraine fetches it.

<br><strong>A</strong>&nbsp&nbspd&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspl&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdrum of leaky roofs, a roofer who patches it,
<br><strong>L</strong>&nbsp&nbspl&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspy&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspd prowls the streets, still clutching his putter.
<br><strong>C</strong>&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbspn&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspf&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspormity caught here, nobody catches it.

<br><strong>T</strong>&nbsp&nbsph&nbsp&nbspe tediumed rake, the retiree who matches it, 
<br><strong>T</strong>&nbsp&nbsph&nbsp&nbspe fall air gone dead with the pure drone of motors
<br><strong>W</strong>&nbsp&nbsph&nbsp&nbspi&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspl&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspe Lloyd hits the ball, and Lorraine just fetches it.

<br><strong>T</strong>&nbsp&nbsph&nbsp&nbspe door is ajar, then somebody latches it.
<br><strong>T</strong>&nbsp&nbsph&nbsp&nbspr&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspugh the hissing of barbecues poets mutter 
<br><strong>O</strong>&nbsp&nbspf conformity caught here, where nobody catches it.
<br><strong>L</strong>&nbsp&nbspl&nbsp&nbspo&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspy&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspd hits the ball. And damned Lorraine fetches it.
